Range from tv to light gun
How many rounds is many?

Reward good users how?

a.
Headline: Hit detection not working correctly
Summary: User reports that hit detection is not working correctly, 
White boxes around the ducks are showing correctly, not sure if the screen is turning black.

b.
from the description it could be either the gun/sensor that does not work. Or it could be that the user is not able to hit, is not pointing the gun at the screen when pulling the trigger.
-  I would move it forward, by trying to get the gun, so I could see if it is the sensor that is not working, if not possible to get the gun then contact the user, try to see if the sensor on the gun is not working.


API Test:
Testing plan/Scenarios
Update correctly - status 200
Missing information in body - gives status 400
Incorrect information in body - status 400
Incorrect appid - 404
Status code 500 - how do I get that?

Load Test:
Using a tool (maybe J-meter), create an update, that updates 1000+ times, first the same request, and then different requests, each time checking for an answer of status 200
